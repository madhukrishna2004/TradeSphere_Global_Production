They're ideal for small lawns and are environmentally friendly since they don't use fuel or electricity.\n\n2. **Walk-Behind Gas Lawn Mowers**: These are powered by gasoline engines and are suitable for medium to large lawns. They offer more power and cutting efficiency than manual push mowers.\n\n3. **Walk-Behind Electric Lawn Mowers**: These are either corded or battery-powered, offering a quieter and more environmentally friendly option compared to gas mowers. They're ideal for small to medium lawns.\n\n4. **Self-Propelled Lawn Mowers**: These mowers are similar to walk-behind mowers but have a drivetrain that propels them forward, making it easier to mow larger areas without exerting as much effort.\n\n5. **Riding Lawn Mowers**: These are suitable for large lawns and allow the operator to sit while mowing. They cover large areas quickly and efficiently.\n\n6. **Zero-Turn Mowers**: A type of riding mower designed for very large lawns and commercial use. They offer excellent maneuverability, allowing tight turns around obstacles.\n\n7. **Robotic Lawn Mowers**: These autonomous mowers work similarly to robotic vacuum cleaners.
